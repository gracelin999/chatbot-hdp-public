S'-  INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n        Patients will be identified for this protocol who are enrolled on existing protocols\n        studying patients with disorders of the immune system who volunteer for participation and\n        who do not have any of the listed exclusion criteria. Patients will remain enrolled on\n        their existing protocol. Normal volunteers will be enrolled as controls on this protocol.\n        They will be recruited through the normal volunteer office which will provide a list of\n        volunteers including their age to allow for inclusion of controls that approximate the\n        study population.\n\n        All patients enrolled on this protocol will be over the age of 18 and may be male or\n        female and will be accrued without regard to religion, race or sexual orientation. They\n        must be able to understand and sign informed consent documents and comply with study\n        procedures that include undergoing a CT scan and an MRI scan. Patients who are unable or\n        unwilling to complete one or more of the studies will not be excluded. The available data\n        will be included in the appropriate analysis.\n\n        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n        For Participation in MRI-Based Studies Only:\n\n          1. Subjects with contraindication to MRI scanning. These contraindications include but\n             are not limited to the following devices or conditions:\n\n               1. Implanted cardiac pacemaker or defibrillator\n\n               2. Cochlear Implants\n\n               3. Ocular foreign body (i.e., metal shavings)\n\n               4.

Medical infusion pumps\n\n               8. Any implanted device that is incompatible with MRI\n\n          2. Patients whose medical condition is such that in the referring physicians estimation,\n             they could not tolerate an MRI scan. Examples of medical conditions that would not be\n             accepted would include unstable angina and dyspnea at rest.\n\n          3. Subjects with a condition precluding entry into the scanner (e.g. morbid obesity,\n             claustrophobia, etc.) or who require sedation for anxiety associate with MRI studies.\n\n          4. Pregnant or lactating women are excluded from this study because excessive exposure\n             of the developing human fetus and child to radiation and/or intravenous contrast\n             agents can be detrimental.\n\n          5. Subjects with severe back-pain or motion disorders who will be unable to tolerate\n             supine positioning within the MRI scanner and hold still for the duration of the\n             examination.\n\n             For Gadolinium-Based MRI Studies Only:\n\n          6. History of severe allergic reaction to gadolinium contrast agents despite the use of\n             premedication with an anti-histaminic and/or corticosteroid.\n\n          7. eGFR less than 60mL/min\n\n          8. Serum creatinine greater than 3.0 mg/dl\n\n             For Iodine-Based Contrast CT Studies Only:\n\n          9. Contraindication to the use of iodine based CT contrast agents:\n\n               1. Serum creatinine greater than 1.4 mg/dl\n\n               2. History of multiple myeloma\n\n               3. Use of metformin-containing products less than 24 hours prior to contrast\n                  administration\n\n               4. History of significant allergic reaction to CT contrast agents despite the use\n                  of premedication with an anti-histaminic and cortisone.\n\n             For Coronary CT Angiography Only:\n\n         10. Contraindication to the use of CT contrast agents:\n\n               1. Creatinine value greater than1.4 mg/dl\n\n               2. History of multiple myeloma\n\n               3. Use of metformin-containing products less than 24 hours prior to contrast\n                  administration\n\n               4. History of significant allergic reaction to CT contrast agents despite the use\n                  of premedication with an anti-histaminic and cortisone.\n\n         11. Subjects with contraindication precluding the use of beta blockers necessary to\n             perform the coronary CT angiography. These include:\n\n               1. Severe, uncontrolled asthma\n\n               2. Active bronchospasm\n\n               3. Moderate or severe COPD\n\n               4. 2nd or 3rd degree AV block\n\n               5. Decompensated cardiac failure\n\n               6. Allergy to beta blockers\n\n               7. Systolic blood pressure less than100 mm Hg\n\n               8. Pregnancy or nursing\n\n                  Participation of Minors: Atherosclerosis is a disease that does not generally\n                  affect young children. This protocol involves exposure to a low dose of\n                  radiation. As radiation exposure may increase the risk of malignancy, it is\n                  prudent to avoid this in children. Therefore, patients under the age of 18 will\n                  not be considered for enrollment under this protocol.\n\n                  Participation of Women: Excessive radiation exposure of the developing human\n                  fetus can be detrimental. For this reason, women of childbearing-age will have a\n                  pregnancy test prior to undergoing study procedures. Should a woman become\n                  pregnant or suspect that she is pregnant while participating in this study, she\n                  should immediately inform study staff and her primary care physician.\n\n                  Pregnancy: Pregnant women are excluded from this study because excessive\n                  exposure of the developing human fetus to radiation can be detrimental.\n\n                  Co-enrollment Guidelines: Co-enrollment in other trials is not restricted.\n\n                  Medical Exclusions: Patients with current atrial fibrillation will not be\n                  considered for enrollment under this protocol. Patients who are medically\n                  unstable (e.g. severe sepsis, acute myocardial infarction) and/or would require\n                  active, acute medical management in order to be medically stable enough to\n                  participate in this protocol will not be enrolled.\n\n                  X-linked CGD Cohort: Patients in this cohort must have X-linked CGD as\n                  demonstrated by DHR or genetic screening. Patients who have undergone bone\n                  marrow transplant may not be enrolled in this cohort for analysis.\n\n                  AutosomalRecessive CGD Cohort: Patients in this cohort must have autosomal\n                  recessive CGD (p47phox, p67phox, or p22phox deficiency) as demonstrated by DHR\n                  or genetic screening. Patients who have undergone bone marrow transplant may not\n                  be enrolled in this cohort for analysis.\n\n                  Inflammatory Bowel Disease Cohort: Patients enrolled into this cohort may not\n                  have been diagnosed with CGD.\n\n                  Normal Volunteer Cohort: Patients in this cohort may not have been diagnosed\n                  with CGD, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, or another primary disease of the immune\n                  system.'

Endoscopic\n             evidence of active disease confirmed on histology within 3 months prior to\n             enrollment, or ii. Clear evidence of active small bowel Crohn's disease on small\n             bowel imaging within 3 months prior to enrollment.\n\n          3.

S'-  SUBJECT INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n        Subjects who meet ALL of the following criteria will be considered for enrollment into\n        this study:\n\n          1. Be 18 to 65 years of age, inclusive, as of the date of enrollment.\n\n          2. Be willing to take appropriate measures to avoid pregnancy during the study period.\n             Subject to the judgment and discretion of the PI, participants who meet ANY of the\n             criteria listed immediately below, as well as male participants who are in a\n             monogamous relationship with a woman who meets ANY of the criteria below, may not be\n             required to take any pregnancy avoidance measures (e.g. barrier methods). Such\n             participants will be counseled on risks at the time of consent and at appropriate\n             points (e.g. when pregnancy testing occurs) during the study:\n\n               1. Females who have had their uterus, and/or BOTH ovaries removed\n\n               2. Females who have had BOTH fallopian tubes surgically tied or removed\n\n               3. Females who have undergone other permanent birth control procedures, such as\n                  endometrial ablation or sterilization (such as Essure or Novasure), and have had\n                  any required follow up testing to confirm the effectiveness of the permanent\n                  birth control procedure.\n\n               4. Females who are above the age of 50 and have spontaneously had no menses at any\n                  point during the past 12 or more consecutive months (i.e. have reached\n                  menopause).\n\n               5. Females who, in the conservative and reasonable judgment of the PI (e.g. due to\n                  sexual orientation, or serious life choice), from the time of enrollment until\n\n                  12 weeks after the last BMSC infusion, will NOT participate in any potentially\n                  reproductive sexual contact (i.e. sexual intercourse with a male partner).\n\n               6. Males who have had a vasectomy and have had the follow-up testing confirming\n                  zero sperm count in their semen.\n\n          3. Any subject who does NOT meet the criteria listed in #2 above, will be appropriately\n             counseled on reproductive risks and pregnancy avoidance, and will be required to\n             adhere to the following measures, as agreed upon by the subject and the PI until at\n             least 12 weeks after the last BMSC infusion:\n\n               1.

Has any medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the investigator,\n             contraindicates participation in this protocol.\n\n         20. Has only small bowel IBD that is inaccessible by standard colonoscopy to obtain\n             research biopsies. For this reason patients with only upper gastrointestinal IBD are\n             also excluded.\n\n         21. Refuses to abstain from using COX-2 inhibitors or NSAIDs throughout the 4 week study\n             drug infusion period.'

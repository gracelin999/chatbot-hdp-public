Medications called Glucagon and MultiHance will be given thru the IV catheter during the imaging study. The glucagon will decrease the movement of the intestines, which helps provide better images of the bowel. MultiHance is a contrast that helps create clearer MRE images. In addition to the MultiHance, the subject will be given an oral contrast medication called VoLumen to drink approximately 45 minutes before the MRE imaging is started. These medications are used for all clinically necessary MRE studies performed in children and adults at the UMHS. The MRE will take approximately 50 to 60 minutes to complete.|Pediatric small bowel Crohn disease|'

The exams will be done by two different physicians.\nIn order to assess the tolerance, after the completion of both exams, the patients will be asked to answer a "comfort score" questionnaire.\nIn order to assess the safety of the CVC, the patients will have a follow-up for adverse events over a 3 weeks period after completion of the CVC and only if the colon video capsule was not recovered during the conventional colonoscopy.|video capsule endoscopy|PillCam colon 2'
